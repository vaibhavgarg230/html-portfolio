<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome to my profile.<br/>
I am Vaibhav Garg, a Web Developer.<br/>
I break down complex user experience problems to create integrity focused solutions that connect billions of people. </p>

<p>I am an undergraduate student in Computer Science and Engineering at MNIT Jaipur. Recently, I have completed my first year. Currently, my summer vacations are going on. So I thought to utilise them in a productive way. In order to achieve this goal, I bought a course from Udemy, The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootamp -  By Dr. AngelaYu.
  <br/>
  It is really an interesting course. Well, I learnt about various HTML tags and the HTML Boilerplate in it. After that, I am building my first portfolio website. I haven't learnt CSS and Javascript yet. So, the webiste has been made accordingly.
  <br/>
  Hopefully, you will like it!
